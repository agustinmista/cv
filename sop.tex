\maketitle 
   
    Four years of Computer Science study and a succesfull student internship at
    the Argentina's scientific research institute led me to where I am today:
    wanting to become an active member of the scientific community, interested
    in research fields such as Theory of Programming Languages and Systems
    Security. 

    My personal interest for the academia begun right after my mind was exposed
    to the concept of Functional Programming (more precisely with the Haskell
    programming language) at a data structures course of my university,
    wondering myself about the many advantages that comes with a programming
    language with such a strong mathematical underliying machinery. Many
    concepts of the categoy theory that I had to study now have a \emph{useful}
    application in real world sofware! 

    My first approach to the scientific research ecosystem was at my student
    internship CIFAFIS-CONICET under the supervision of Gustavo Grieco and
    Mart\'in Ceresa, where I actively participated improving QuickFuzz, a
    Haskell written experimental grammar fuzzer able to found security bugs in
    real world applications and libraries. In particular, I have studied and
    implemented a technique to automatically derive the algebra of third-party
    libraries using metaprogramming. During this internship, we also wrote an
    article submitted to the the Journal of Systems and Software, describing
    the state of the art techniques used and the results obtained in the later
    stages of development of QuickFuzz. This article is currently under
    revision. 

    After finishing my student internship, I kept working at CIFASIS-CONICET
    where I am doing research relevant to my Master's thesis, related to the
    structural minimization of bug inducing test cases.   

    Once I finish my Master in Computer Science studies, I am interested to
    apply for a PhD. position where I could make active research on the fields
    of my interest. In particular, I aim to make a progress in how functional
    programming and software security can converge to led in better and safer
    systems.

    Since my geographical situation does not offer many academic events of this
    degree of relevance, I believe that having an opportunity to assist to the
    Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School would be an
    important step in the direction I want my academic career to evolve.
